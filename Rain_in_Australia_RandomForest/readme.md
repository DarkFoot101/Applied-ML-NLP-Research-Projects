# 🌧️ Rain Prediction Model — Rain in Australia Dataset

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **machine learning–based rainfall prediction system** using the **Rain in Australia dataset**.  
The objective is to predict whether it will rain the following day by leveraging historical weather observations and applying supervised learning techniques.

The project focuses on **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization** to improve prediction accuracy.
