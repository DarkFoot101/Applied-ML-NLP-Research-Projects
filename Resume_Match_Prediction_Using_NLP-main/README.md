# 🧠 Resume Matcher using Natural Language Processing

---

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Resume Matching & Ranking System (NLP)

An **NLP-based resume screening web application** designed to automate and improve the recruitment shortlisting process by matching resumes against job descriptions using semantic understanding rather than keyword filtering.

#### Key Features
- **Batch Resume Processing** – Supports uploading and analyzing hundreds of resumes simultaneously.
- **Keyword & Skill Extraction** – Extracts relevant skills, qualifications, and experience using NLP techniques.
- **Semantic Similarity Matching** – Compares resumes with job descriptions based on contextual relevance.
- **Custom Scoring & Ranking** – Ranks candidates using a relevance-based scoring mechanism.
- **Interactive Web Interface** – Enables recruiters to upload resumes, input job descriptions, and view ranked results.

#### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Core Techniques:** NLP, semantic similarity, text preprocessing

### 2️⃣ Book Recommendation System

A **collaborative filtering–based recommendation system** built to suggest books based on user interaction patterns.

#### Key Features
- Trained on **10,000+ user–item interactions**
- Uses **cosine similarity indexing** for recommendation generation
- Implements **unsupervised learning techniques**
- Inspired by **Kaggle-style recommendation problems**

#### Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy
